**Learning:** For long pages like Plans or History, a scroll-to-top button improves navigation efficiency. Using a transition on `opacity` and `transform` provides a smooth entry/exit effect that feels more polished than a sudden appearance.
**Action:** Implement scroll-to-top buttons with `fixed`, `bottom-8`, `right-8` positioning and toggle classes `opacity-0 translate-y-24` based on scroll position using a small vanilla JS script.
