## 2025-12-31 - [Hero Pattern for Empty States]
**Learning:** Users often feel lost when confronting empty lists. Replacing generic alert banners with a "Hero" component (large icon, clear title, explanatory text, and primary CTA) significantly improves perceived value and guidability.
**Action:** When implementing empty states for core entities (like Plans), use the DaisyUI `hero` component with a centered layout and direct call-to-action button, ensuring the icon is visually distinct but not overwhelming (e.g., low opacity).
